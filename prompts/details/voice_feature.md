Add a “Read Aloud” feature that reads the explanation section of each Bible passage using text-to-speech (TTS).


Add a “Read Aloud” button next to the explanation text.

Use the Web Speech API (SpeechSynthesis) or any library like react-speech-kit to perform text-to-speech.

Button toggles between Play / Pause (or Stop).

Automatically stops when the explanation changes or user clicks Stop.

Optional: Add a volume/speed slider for better UX.

Ensure accessibility (ARIA attributes) and smooth UI transitions.

Work in both light and dark mode.
